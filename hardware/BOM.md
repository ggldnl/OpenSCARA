## Notes

- Keep in mind that the cost per unit, and consequently the total cost, may vary depending on where you source the parts. For this reason I have not included sourcing links. The listed unit prices reflect now much I paid for each item.
- I did not include zip ties, spiral wraps for the cables and the labels (for which you will also need a labeling machine).
- The aluminum rods I bought are hollow, but this doesn't matter. It's just what was available at the time.
- I added a 12V fan to cool down the stepper drivers but this is totally optional and thus omitted from the BOM.
- Number of locknuts used (only where vibrations could break the arm): 8
- Number of heat set inserts used: 24
- Complete list of M2 screws used: 6x M2x16 screw + 6x M2 nuts to keep the micro switches in place 
- Complete list of M3 screws used:
